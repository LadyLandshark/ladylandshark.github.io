I am Keara Hill, Upstate New York native and Digital Equipment Corporation fan. Currently I am a PhD Candidate in CS at Binghamton University, working on probabilistic methods for reasoning about software exploitability with [Eric Atkinson](https://eatkinson.ca/). 

Previously I worked as a Software Engineer for Grammatech (Oct 2019-Feb 2023) and Assured Information Security (Sept 2015-Sept 2019) working on various projects in the defensive security space.

Additionally, I have been _DJ Landshark_ at [WHRW 90.5FM](https://whrw.fm/) on and off since December 2012. I play songs on the continuum from blues to garage rock, so if that sounds up your alley please tune in!

Some other hobbies include boxing, horses, and fountain pens.
